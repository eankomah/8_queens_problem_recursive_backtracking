# 8_queens_problem_recursive_backtracking
The 8-queen problem solves the task of finding a placement of 8 queens on a standard 8x8 chessboard such that no two queens threaten each other by being in the same row, column, or diagonal. It is a classic problem in computer science and mathematics, and its solution involves algorithmic thinking and problem-solving skills. This code is the python implementation of the recursive backtracking algorithm
